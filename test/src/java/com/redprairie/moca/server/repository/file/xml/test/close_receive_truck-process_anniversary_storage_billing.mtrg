  <p> 
       This trigger calls the process anniversary storage billing
       which established the anniversary storage charges on 
       received product.  This is run when the reveive truck
       is closed. This must run off of receive truck close because this
       is the only point when all the product has been received into
       inventory and anniversary storage calculations can commence.
